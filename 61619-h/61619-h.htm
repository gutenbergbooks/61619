<p>Gnomes were Teddy's favorites. He had no brothers
and sisters, so was obliged to make up games for himself,
and invent people to play with him, and the people
were almost always gnomes.</p>

<p>At the foot of the lawn which stretched before the house
where he lived, stood an oak-tree. This tree was so old that
the trunk was quite hollow, and Teddy could squeeze inside it
by making himself small. It was here that all his wonderful
adventures began. He always went to the oak every morning,
vaguely hoping at sometime to catch sight of a belated elf, who
might be lurking about after the day had really begun.</p>

<p>It had been raining for two days, and Teddy had been
kept indoors with a cold, which he hated very much, so on the
third morning, when Mamma allowed him to run out for a little
while he made all haste to the oak-tree, because he felt that
something would be changed and he was quite disappointed to
find everything looking just as usual. But when he went inside,
however, there was a difference; a small trap door, with a brass
ring in it, had appeared in the bottom of the tree.</p>

<p>Teddy was delighted, as he was sure the door had not been
there two days ago, and he couldn't imagine what it was for.
In a minute he was trying to get it open, tugging at the brass
ring as hard as he could. It was a tough struggle, but the door
yielded at last, and so suddenly that Teddy fell over backward
out through the opening of the tree. He didn't mind that, and
was up in a jiffy, looking down the black hole which he had uncovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
At first he couldn't see anything, then gradually made out
some steps, at the bottom of which it seemed to be lighter.
Ted hesitated, it was dark at the top, and he didn't know how
far away the light might be, but he made up his mind to go
down, and he went cautiously, backward, as on a ladder. It
was a long flight. When he reached the bottom step at last, he
saw that the light came from an opening at the end of the passage,
and was much farther off than it looked, but he kept on
and when at last he arrived where it was brighter, he found himself
in a new and strange country.</p>

<p>To his surprise everything was blue,&mdash;grass, leaves on the
trees, flowers, all a deep, lovely blue, like the sea. Teddy stared
about in much astonishment. There was no one in sight, but
he heard a sort of soft, humming sound, like people singing. It
seemed to come from the left, so he ran off in that direction,
and on turning a corner, saw a hill in front of him, up which
he climbed, and there the funniest sight met his eyes.</p>

<p>Below, in a round clearing, was an open-air workshop.
Tools of all kinds stood about, and in the center of a furnace in
full blast, and hard at work were hundreds of little, blue
gnomes. They were all hammering, sawing, and planing, making
wooden tables and chairs of a very curious kind that Teddy
had never seen before. They kept up an odd, chanting song,
as they worked, and this was what Teddy had heard. The
words were something like these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Let us sing as we work,</div>
<div class="line i1">As hard as we're able,</div>
<div class="line">Let us sing as we finish</div>
<div class="line i1">Each chair, and each table.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The giants will come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></div>
<div class="line i1">If we cease from our song,</div>
<div class="line">And eat us all up,</div>
<div class="line i1">So sing, sing along."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another curious thing Teddy noticed, was the presence of
about a hundred blue elephants. They walked in solemn procession
around the outskirts of the open space, each one holding
with his trunk the tail of the one in front of him. Occasionally,
the largest would put up his trunk and trumpet, and then they all
would do the same, solemnly turn around, and walk the other
way.</p>

<p>While Teddy stood watching these strange sights one of
the gnomes, who seemed to be an overseer, looked up and saw
him. He gave a cry, which was echoed by the others, then with
one accord they stopped working, ran up the hill, and threw
themselves on the ground before Teddy, shouting.</p>

<p>"He has come, he has come, our preserver, our preserver!"
Teddy was a good deal embarrassed at this reception, and didn't
know exactly what to say, so he took off his hat, and bowed
very politely, and said nothing. The gnomes, on the contrary,
talked all the time, and all together, which made a great deal of
noise, and was pretty confusing. Teddy heard the word "giant,"
again and again, also the word "kill," and he wondered if he
were to kill a giant, and if so, with what. After a while, they
seemed to realize that he didn't understand so they all fell back
a little way, and the leader, the one who had given notice of
Teddy's arrival, stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Teddy, we are glad to see you. We have watched you
for a long, long time, and always hoped to have a visit from you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
but we were obliged to wait before putting up the steps and the
trap door, until you yourself had expressed a desire to help us,
which you did last Saturday. Perhaps you remember saving one
of my people from being killed by a cat on Saturday."</p>

<p>Teddy looked puzzled. "It was a frog I saved," he said.
"Topsy was going to eat it, and I was afraid she would get sick."</p>

<p>"It was <i>not</i> a frog," said the gnome with much displeasure,
"you may have <i>thought</i> it was a frog, but it was not." He
seemed so put out that Teddy felt himself growing very red and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I am sure I am very sorry," he said, "and I am glad I
was able to help you."</p>

<p>The gnome continued, but with much severity, "you then
said, after you had driven away the savage animal,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Topsy is not a savage animal," interrupted Ted, "she is
a very nice cat."</p>

<p>"She is a savage animal to us," said the gnome, and all
the other gnomes repeated, "savage animal," in a sort of a growl.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," the gnome went on, "after having
driven away the savage animal, you said you wished you could
be like the celebrated "Jack the Giant-Killer," and then we
decided you would help us, and we put up the steps and door."</p>

<p>"What am I to do, now that I am here?" asked Teddy,
much perplexed, "am I to kill a giant?"</p>

<p>"You are to kill six," replied the gnome, calmly, while a
joyful chorus of "<i>six</i>" came from the hundreds of little gnomes
standing by.</p>

<p>"Six," echoed Teddy, faintly, "I&mdash;I don't think I could
kill six, I'm not sure I could kill <i>one</i>, alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"<i>Not</i> kill the six giants," said the gnome, in a voice of
anger and surprise, "then why did you come?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," and Teddy began to wish heartily that
he had never found the trap door, and never visited Gnome-land.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, in which Teddy shifted his feet,
twisted his cap into a string, and felt very unhappy and awkward.
Then the silence was broken by the biggest gnome, who
came a little closer to Teddy, and said, calmly, but firmly;</p>

<p>"You expressed a wish to kill a giant, here there are six,
who come every night, when we are asleep and cannot sing, and
when our elephants are obliged to leave us to attend to their
other duties. When we wake in the morning, we find our work
all undone and broken, our tools made useless, and often many
of our number killed. You must rid us of these pests, and if
you cannot think of a way now, you must remain here in captivity
until you do." So speaking he led Teddy to a cave in
the side of the hill, and pushed him in.</p>

<p>"When you are ready," he said, "you have only to blow
this whistle loudly, twice, and you will be released," then the
door closed, and Teddy found himself alone.</p>

<p>For a few minutes all he heard was the pattering of hundreds
of little feet, going down the hill, then the chanting song
commenced again, and he knew that they had gone back to
their work.</p>

<p>Teddy was thoroughly frightened; he had no idea how
to kill giants, though he had often thought about it, but now
that the chance had come he couldn't think of a single way to
accomplish it, and after a while he began to cry. While he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
crying very hard, he heard a scratchy sound, and looking up,
saw a little red squirrel, coming in through a crack in the cave.
The squirrel winked very solemnly with one bright eye, and then
remarked,</p>

<p>"I wouldn't cry if I were you."</p>

<p>"What would you do?" said Ted, rather put out by the
squirrel's tone.</p>

<p>"I'd go to work," was the answer, delivered with another
wink.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to," said Teddy, "and I can't get out
if I did know."</p>

<p>"You must find Mamma Know-all," said the squirrel
whisking his tail, "she will help you, she knows you well, she
is in your house a lot of the time."</p>

<p>"At my house?" said Teddy, much surprised, "whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"That would be telling," and the squirrel winked again.</p>

<p>Teddy rose to his feet, "Let us go and find her at once,"
he said, "if I have to do this thing there is no use in waiting
any longer."</p>

<p>"Now you are acting with some sense," said the squirrel,
"blow your whistle and tell them you must be let out any way,
that you can't think locked up, and then start to your left, thro'
the woods and I will join you," with that he scurried into the
darkness, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Teddy then blew his whistle twice, loudly, and instantly
the door opened, and he walked out. No one was in sight, so
he obeyed the squirrel's instructions, and ran to the woods, where
the squirrel joined him. He walked quite a long way with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
"Red-tail" sitting on his shoulder, and at last arrived at a house,
on the side of a steep hill. Here "Red-tail" got down from
Teddy's shoulder, and hid in a tree.</p>

<p>"I don't like Mamma Know-all," he said, "you can talk
to her."</p>

<p>So Teddy knocked at the door, and a funny, little old
woman came out. Teddy told her his troubles, and she agreed
to help him.</p>

<p>"I've known for a long time how to kill the giants," she
said, "but nobody has ever thought to ask me to help, and I
can't think why they supposed a little boy like you could do it
without me. I'm going to give you three oranges, which you
must peel as you need them. The Looking-glass Sea is at the
top of this hill, and the giants live on the other side of the Sea.
Do not use the oranges unless you have to, and above all things,
do not step on the peel."</p>

<p>Teddy thanked her very much, took the oranges, and began
promptly to climb the hill, where the squirrel was waiting
for him.</p>

<p>They soon reached the top, and before them, stretched the
Looking-glass Sea. Directly opposite stood the gray castle belonging
to the six giants. It had six enormous doors, six enormous
windows, one over each door, and also six chimneys. It
stood so close to the edge of the sea, that Teddy saw its reflection
quite clearly, which made it seem twice its real size. He
stared at the castle in hopeless despair.</p>

<p>"They must be large giants," he said.</p>

<p>"They are," answered the squirrel, "the very largest."</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd better cross the sea," remarked Teddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you'd better <i>try</i> to cross the sea," said the
squirrel.</p>

<p>So Teddy put one foot on the edge, then the other foot
and then he took one step, and then he landed flat on his back
with a most awful thump. This both surprised and hurt him,
and he crawled on his hands and knees to the bank, feeling discouraged.</p>

<p>"I think I had better peel an orange," he said, " I'll never
be able to walk over."</p>

<p>The squirrel agreed to this, and they did it together, being
very careful to throw the peel behind them, so that they should
not step on it.</p>

<p>Just as they finished, the orange slipped from Teddy's hand,
skipped off on the sea, and turned into a pair of beautiful big
wheels, all nicely rubber tired, like bicycle wheels, and with a
little seat swung in between them. Teddy was much delighted,
and lost no time in taking the seat. The wheels instantly began
to roll over the sea, and when he was very nearly across he saw
to his horror, looming up on the opposite bank, a very large
bright green Griffin, with a long scaly tail, and very big claws.
The wheels seemed to be as frightened as Teddy, for they stopped
short, and Teddy and the Griffin looked at each other. Finally
the Griffin roared at him.</p>

<p>"What do you want here boy?" Teddy didn't wish to
say what he really wanted, so he gave a pleasant smile, and said:</p>

<p>"I came to see you." The Griffin looked as if he didn't
believe that, and invited Teddy ashore, but Teddy was not to
be caught so easily, and <i>he</i> invited the Griffin to come out on
the Looking-glass Sea. This the Griffin refused to do, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Teddy asked the wheels to wheel him as close to the bank as
was safe, which they did, then the little seat lowered him to the
ice, and the wheels disappeared.</p>

<p>Teddy sat there and looked at the Griffin, and wondered
what the next move should be, when it suddenly occurred to him
that it was time to use another orange. There was no place to
leave the peel except on the sea, but the squirrel managed to
carry the pieces quite off to the right, so that they wouldn't be
in the way.</p>

<p>When Teddy had finished peeling, the orange slipped out
of his hand, just as the other had done, shot to the bank, and
promptly turned into a dozen little cakes.</p>

<p>"Have some cake," said Teddy.</p>

<p>"You come and hand them to me," said the Griffin.</p>

<p>"No, you reach them for yourself," said Teddy, "they are
near the edge."</p>

<p>Now the Griffin liked cakes, very much indeed, and these
had pink frosting on them, and looked very delicious, so he
gingerly leaned over the edge, and took one, and finding it good,
ate them all.</p>

<p>Just as he finished the last one, he began to bellow and
roar, and made such a noise that the giants all woke up, and
each one rushed to a window, and pushed out his head.</p>

<p>Now these giants were very peculiar. Each had different
colored hair, and a great deal of it,&mdash;the first one black, the
second brown, the third white, the fourth yellow, the fifth red
and the sixth bright green. As they stuck out their heads, each
through his own window, they presented a very fascinating and
yet, awful appearance. They seemed much upset at hearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
griffin roar and see him stagger around, and they shouted to him
all together.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter? What <i>has</i> happened?"</p>

<p>"I'm killed," said the Griffin, "and by that dreadful little
boy. Come out and put an end to him," and with that he
exploded, and flew up into the sky, like a big green cloud.</p>

<p>The giants screamed with rage, and calling to Teddy to
wait till they came down, each drew in his head and disappeared:
But they re-appeared in a minute, armed with enormous
clubs, and were soon at the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>"Come here," they called, "come here, you young rascal,"
and shook their sticks at him, but Teddy sat where he was, and
laughed, they looked so funny, all standing on the bank, with
their different colored hair.</p>

<p>Finally the one with the red hair became so angry that he
stepped on the Looking-glass Sea, and put his foot on the
orange peel that the squirrel had laid in a nice heap. His feet
flew out from under him just as Teddy's had done, and he came
down with such an awful crash that he went right through and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"There's one gone," said the squirrel, pleased "and easily
too. Now how about the other five?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Teddy doubtfully, "had I better peel
the last orange?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you had," said the squirrel, "it's your last
chance, and if it doesn't work, we're lost."</p>

<p>Teddy nodded as he was too busy to answer. He was
throwing the pieces of peel at the giants, and as he threw them
they turned into little sharp stones, and hit them, and hurt them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and that made them still more angry, and they called all the
louder to him, but they didn't dare step on the sea.</p>

<p>When Teddy finished the orange he laid it carefully down
beside him, and waited to see what would happen. For at
least five minutes it stayed where he had put it, and then it disappeared
and Teddy began to be awfully frightened, when all
of a sudden he heard a very strange sound, and turned to look
in the direction from which it came. The sound continued
drawing nearer and nearer. It was a funny noise, swishy and
squashy, now faint, now loud, but surely coming closer all the
time. The giants heard it, and grew uneasy; they pressed to
the shore of the sea, and threatened Teddy more and more with
their clubs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as Teddy had begun to think Mammy-Know-all
had gone back on him altogether, a cloud of great
white birds appeared, thousands of them, all flapping their wings
together, till it sounded like the roll of drums. They descended
upon the giants, pecking them with their bills, and smothering
them with their wings, till the giants in desperation, ran out on
the sea, and all fell through!</p>

<p>The very second the green one sank out of sight, the
Looking-glass Sea turned into water, and Teddy and the Squirrel
were glad enough to scramble into a piece of orange peel which
had turned into a little yellow boat.</p>

<p>Just as they were wondering which way they ought to go
they heard a great hullabaloo from the opposite shore, and there
were all the gnomes, ranged along the bank, shouting and waving
at Teddy, begging him to make haste over, that they might
crown him their king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
But Teddy didn't want to go over, he didn't want to be
a king, he was tired of the gnomes, and their blue elephants,
and their hollow trees, and he didn't propose to go back, and
be told to kill anything more, so he asked the squirrel if he
knew how he could get home some other way, and the squirrel
said, "shut your eyes, and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">One, two, three,</div>
<div class="line">Oak tree, oak tree."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was no sooner said than done, and immediately he found
himself in the hollow oak, at the foot of the steps, and lost no
time in climbing to the top. As he shut the trap door behind
him, he heard the shouts of the gnomes, calling him to come
back, and be their king, but he and the squirrel fastened the
trap door in its place, <i>quickly</i>, and then a very funny thing
happened.</p>

<p>The squirrel who had been so friendly just the minute
before, suddenly became very wild, and ran chattering out of
the oak-tree, and though Teddy ran after him, called him,
begged him to come back, reminded him of the lovely time
they had just had, he only ran further away, and finally disappeared
up a beech-tree leaving Teddy standing disconsolately at
the foot, wondering whether the thing had really happened, or
whether it was all a dream!</p>

<h2 id="MOON">GERTRUDE'S VISIT TO THE MOON</h2></div>


<p>Did you ever hear of a little girl so fond of looking at
the moon, that she quite forgot to obey her mother
and stay in bed, if she thought there was a chance of
watching the big silver globe, as it hung in the sky?
Well, I am going to tell you about this little girl.</p>

<p>Her name was Gertrude; she was nine years old, and
looked much the same as other little girls of nine, and was just
about as tall. Except for her love of the moon, she was only
an ordinary little girl, with hair to be curled, lessons to learn
and all such unpleasant things to attend to.</p>

<p>One night Gertrude's mamma had tucked her safely in bed
and left her with a kiss, and she lay wondering whether the
moon were shining, as it seemed very dark, and whether she
dared get up for one peep or not, when bang! away went the
window shade, right to the top, without any warning, and
instantly the room was filled with a silver light.</p>

<p>Gertrude sat up and softly put first one foot out of bed,
then the other, and running to the window, looked out. There
was the moon gazing down at her with what seemed a kindly
smile on its broad face, and from it came straight to her window,
a beautiful band of white light, like a sort of fairy bridge.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Gertrude, "I feel as though I could
walk up that lovely bridge, if I had a moon boy or girl to help
me."</p>

<p>As she spoke she noticed something sliding towards her,
down the silvery band, very fast, and while she looked, it grew
bigger and bigger, until it landed on the roof of the Piazza,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
when she saw that it was a white sled, and on it there was the
prettiest little girl she had ever seen. She was of about the
same size as Gertrude, and was dressed all in shimmery white;
even her long hair was such a pale yellow as to be silver. She
smiled at Gertrude and approached the window holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>"I am Amorita," she said, "and I have come from the
Crown Prince; it is his birthday, and he bids me invite you to
his party in the moon."</p>

<p>Gertrude's face was alight all in a minute with joy, and
she cried:</p>

<p>"The Crown Prince! oh, I should love to go with you,
Amorita, but I am not dressed, I have on my nightgown."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the moon child, "that will be arranged later,
you will see. Climb out of the window, and come with
me."</p>

<p>Gertrude needed no more urging; in a second she had
jumped on a chair, and then out to the piazza roof, and seated
herself on the sled.</p>

<p>"How can we slide up hill, Amorita?" she asked. And
Amorita answered, as she clapped her hands together; "Wait,
watch and see."</p>

<p>Gertrude watched, and in a minute two beautiful white
moths appeared, flying slowly and gracefully towards them.
They stopped in front of the sled, and Amorita seizing the white
reins that hung from their harness, they started swiftly up the
shaft of light, drawn by the even motion of the fluffy white
wings.</p>

"AND IN THE BOX A LOVELY PEARL RING"
</div></div>

<p>Up, up, up, until they reached a pair of beautiful white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
gates, which were opened by another moth, and they found
themselves in front of the Moon Palace. They went straight
into a magnificent ballroom, full of people all in white, who
were dancing to the music of a band of white mice playing on
silver instruments. At the end of the room, on a huge throne,
sat the King and Queen, and at their feet sat the Crown Prince,
who, when he saw the children coming, rose, and with an exclamation
of joy, ran to meet them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gertrude," he cried, "I have watched you often
from my window and I love you very much. I have waited so
long to have you come," and he kissed her on the cheek.
Gertrude thought of her nightgown and felt herself blushing
very red, but on looking down, she saw she had on a silver dress
and shoes, and she felt happy again.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince led her to the King and Queen, and
they greeted her with sweet smiles of welcome, bade her dance,
and enjoy herself. The Prince told how much he wanted her
to stay in his world, that when he and she both grew up they
should get married, and be King and Queen of the moon people.</p>

<p>While they were talking about it, a trumpet blew, and
everybody stopped dancing, and formed a procession, headed by
two white rabbits, blowing on silver horns; then came the band,
then the King and Queen and behind them the Crown Prince,
with Gertrude on one side, and Amorita on the other, and behind
them all the ladies and gentlemen of the court.</p>

<p>The dining hall was reached at last and here stood a long
table, in the centre of which was a large birthday cake, with
twelve candles, each burning in a silver rose. The Crown Prince
sat opposite the cake, with Gertrude next to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of the feast, the Prince rose, and introduced
her to all his people, as his little bride, and they cheered, and
drank her health out of big round glasses with the Man in the
Moon painted on them. Then he cut the cake, and in Gertrude's
piece was a little white satin box, and in the box a lovely
pearl ring. The Prince was just putting it on her finger, when
she felt herself slipping, slipping, and before she knew what had
happened,&mdash;she was in bed, and her mamma was standing, looking
at her, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Many happy returns of the day, little girl," said she.
"Look what your Uncle John has sent you," and she handed
her a little box. In it was a ring, just like the ring the Crown
Prince was giving her when she fell out of the moon.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, that is my engagement ring," cried Gertrude,
and as mamma looked very much puzzled, she hastened to
explain.</p>

<p>Mamma seemed to think it was a dream, but Gertrude
likes to think it was not, and nights when the moon is full, she
stands at the window, and waves her hand,&mdash;the hand with the
ring on it, and she believes the Crown Prince sees her and
waves back, even though she cannot see him.</p>

<h2 id="BEARS">JANE AND THE BEARS</h2></div>


<p>Jane loved to read, and above all, to read fairy tales. She
had a great number of books, of every kind, but the one
she liked best was "The Three Bears." Her copy of the
book had very large, bright pictures of Silverlocks, the
Bears and the little house. The story was printed in nice, big,
plain letters, so that Jane had no trouble in reading it to herself
when Mamma was too busy to read it for her. Jane lived on
the outskirts of a wood, and it was her great pleasure to go into
it a little way, and sit down at the foot of an oak-tree, read
about the Bears, and fancy they were alive, and talking to her.</p>

<p>One day she had been dreaming thus for a long time,
when suddenly she felt that the Bears were real, and that by
going into the woods a long way, she could find them just as
Silverlocks had found them. So she shut up the book, tucked
it under her arm, and ran down a little narrow path just ahead
of her. After she had been running quite a while, she became
very much out of breath, for Jane was a fat little girl, so she
stopped and looked about her. It seemed rather dark, the
trees grew so thickly and she felt a little bit frightened, but one
look at the beloved book, still tucked firmly under her arm,
spurred her to venture further before giving up hope altogether.
But the further she went, the darker it grew, and Jane suddenly
realized that it must be getting night, and then,&mdash;she tried to
go home, and couldn't find the way. Finally after trying for
some time, she sat down by a big tree, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>While she was crying very bitterly, she thought she heard a
noise, a sort of scrunchy sound, like a heaving body walking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
She put out her hand and felt something furry. She gave a
scream and started to run away, when a big voice, quite kind,
but oh, so big and gruff, said:</p>

<p>"Little girl, why do you cry?"</p>

<p>Jane answered very timidly, "I cry because I am lost."</p>

<p>"Lost," echoed the big voice, "where were you going"?</p>

<p>"To find the Three bears," sobbed Jane, "and I can't
find them."</p>

<p>"The Three Bears," roared the voice, "why, I am Mr.
Bear, what do you want with us?"</p>

<p>Jane came quite close to him, and peered at him through
the darkness. Mr. Bear, sure enough, big, hairy, and brown, just
like the pictures! Jane quite forgot her manners in the excitement
of the minute, and clasping her two little, fat hands together,
cried,</p>

<p>"Oh, are you truly real bears?"</p>

<p>"<i>Real bears?</i>" roared Mr. Bear, in a voice of thunder, "of
course we're real bears. What an insulting question! I ought
to punish you well for that. <i>Real bears</i>, indeed!" and he
roared louder than ever.</p>

<p>Poor Jane was frightened to death. She sat down on the
ground, and screamed, "Oh, Mr. Bear, I'm so sorry. I will be
good, oh, I will be good. Please don't eat me up!"</p>

<div class="caption">
"JANE AND BABY BEAR PLAYED GAMES"
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Bear grew more gentle when he saw how penitent she
was, and told her if she would climb on his back, he would take
her to Mrs. Bear and the Baby Bear who were waiting for him.
Jane was a little doubtful about accepting the invitation, he
was such a large bear, and she was such a little girl, a nice, fat
morsel, too,&mdash;she had been told so before by her Papa,&mdash;still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the temptation was very great, so she climbed on his broad back,
settled herself comfortably, and off they started.</p>

<p>They journeyed quite a long way, and finally it became
lighter, and the trees grew further apart, until they came to a
clearing, and there, right in the very middle, stood the little
house, with its three doors, its three windows, its three chimneys,
so like the pictures in her book, that Jane almost fell off the
bear's back, when she saw it. They stopped in front of one of
the doors, and out ran the Baby Bear. When he saw Jane sitting
on his father's back, he gave a funny little squeal, and hurried
into the house, calling,</p>

<p>"Oh, Mamma, Mamma, put away my chair, and my blue
bowl, here's another horrid little girl, come with Pa, and I'm sure
she will break them again. She's much bigger than the other
one."</p>

<p>Mamma Bear went to the door. She looked just like the
pictures too, and had a bonnet with strings tied under her chin.</p>

<p>"Mercy me, Pa," she said, "who have you brought now?"</p>

<p>"It's a little girl," said Mr. Bear, "I found her in the
woods, hunting for our house. She's a silly child,"&mdash;this very
severely&mdash;"she believed that we were not real".</p>

<p>Mamma Bear gave a violent roar of rage, and said: "Of
course we are real," in her middle-sized voice, which was not so
squeaky as the Baby Bear's voice, and not so gruff as Papa Bear's.
Jane hastened to apologize again, and begged to be allowed to
see the inside of the house, and as Mamma Bear was very good-natured,
she took her in.</p>

<p>Jane saw the big chair, that was so hard, the middle-sized
chair, that was so soft, and the little chair, that Silverlocks had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
broken, and it was all mended with string. She wanted to sit
in it but the Baby Bear made such a fuss, she gave up the attempt.
They showed her the great, big bowl full of very peppery
soup, the middle-sized bowl full of very salty soup, and the
Baby Bear's bowl, which was mended with glue. He let Jane
taste a little of his soup, just a <i>very</i> little, because he was afraid
she would take it all, and he would have none.</p>

<p>Then they invited her upstairs, and showed her all the
beds, and these she was allowed to try. She had a great deal
of trouble getting up on Mr. Bear's bed, it was so high, and when
she did succeed she was glad to get down again, for it was just
as hard now as when Silverlocks had found it. The middle-sized
bed she passed by almost without looking at it, she was so
anxious to get to Baby Bears bed, and see where Silverlocks had
gone to sleep on that eventful day.</p>

<p>Then they showed the window through which Silverlocks
had jumped out, and the Baby Bear hopefully suggested that Jane
could do the same, if she liked! When they went downstairs
again, Mamma Bear gave Jane some nice little cakes she had baked.</p>

<p>Jane thought she ought to go home, but didn't know how
to go. Mr. Bear said he couldn't possibly take her, it was much
too far. Mamma said <i>she</i> couldn't possibly take her, because
she was much too fat, and Baby Bear said she couldn't possibly
stay where she was because he couldn't think of letting her sleep
in his bed. So it seemed for a little while as though Jane would
never get home. Suddenly Mamma Bear had an idea.</p>

<p>"Why don't you call in Red Riding-Hood's wolf? He
goes by every day, and perhaps he will know how she can get out
of the forest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
So they all went in front of the house, and waited. Jane
and the Baby Bear played games, only the Baby Bear could climb
trees, and Jane couldn't, so in hide-and-go-seek he was able to
get away quite easily.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they heard a galloping sound, and up came
a big, gray wolf. Papa Bear explained to him what they wanted.
The wolf was delighted, but said he had to go first to the Grandmother's
cottage, because Red Riding-hood was there, and he
had a message to give from her mother, but if Jane didn't mind
going too, why, it would be all right. You can easily imagine
Jane was most willing, so they put her on the wolf's back, after
the Baby Bear had hugged her "good-bye".</p>

<p>The wolf went much faster than the Bear, and Jane had
great difficulty in staying on his back, but she managed not to
fall off, and soon they arrived at the Grandmother's cottage, and
found the grandmother and Red Riding-hood positively sitting
down to supper. They invited Jane to have a little of the delicious
cream cheese, and fresh cake which she was very glad to
do. While she was eating she confided to the Grandmother
her troubles about getting home, and Grandmother said if Jane
would take off her clothes, and get right into bed she would be
home in a jiffy. As Jane was rather tired, she didn't mind doing
this at all. She shut her eyes, just as Grandma told her to, and
while she lay there, she could still hear them talking, and she
heard them say:</p>

<p>"Jane, Jane, Jane," and it sounded very familiar, too, it
sounded like Nurse. Why! it couldn't be Nurse! How could
she have come there? Then Jane thought she would have to
open her eyes, and so she did,&mdash;and there she was sitting at the
bottom of the tree, with her book in her lap, and it <i>was</i> Nurse's
voice she heard, and it meant "supper."</p>

<h2 id="PIG">SAPPHIRA AND THE FLYING PIG</h2></div>


<p>Sapphira's mamma and papa owned a flying pig. Of
course people who have not had a flying pig in the
family do not know how uninteresting they are. Sapphira
knew, and the Flying Pig was a great trial to her.
In the first place, he was locked up in a large wire cage so that
he couldn't possibly fly, then he was watched all the time by
two little page boys, so that nothing could ever disturb or annoy
him, and he was never taken out except when the family were
giving a party, and he was called on to entertain the guests.
Sapphira often longed to play with him, he seemed as if he
would be quite a decent playfellow, but he was asleep most of
the time, so that she had grown accustomed to expect nothing
much of him. Of course she went every day, on her way down
to the beach, and said "Good morning, Flying Pig," respectfully,
because after all you had to be respectful to a pig that
could fly if it wanted to, and he always responded, "Good
morning, Sapphira," but he never budged, and he never said
more than that, so Sapphira would leave him, and go on with
her pail and shovel to dig in the sand.</p>

<p>At the beach Sapphira had some real friends, and they
were the Walruses. To be sure they couldn't be frightfully
intimate because they were unable to come in shore for fear of
running aground in the shallow water, so they stayed just outside
the breakers and bobbed up and down over the waves,
their great tusks gleaming in the sunlight, and as their voices
were very loud they could talk to Sapphira easily as she sat on
the beach. They were always very anxious for her to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
out and see them, and they had promised her the loveliest time
if she could only spend the day, but there was always the
difficulty of her getting out through the breakers to them, as
she couldn't swim, so they had been obliged to give it up.</p>

<p>One morning, just as Sapphira had finished a most beautiful
fort with a trench all around it into which the water would
flow when the tide came in, the oldest Walrus shouted to her,</p>

<p>"Sapphira, hasn't your father a Flying Pig?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sapphira.</p>

<p>"Well, why couldn't he bring you out to us?"</p>

<p>"He's locked up," said Sapphira, "the door of the cage
has a padlock, of which father carries the key, and he's watched
all the time by two boys. He couldn't ever get out.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," said the Walrus, "it must be awful to be
locked up."</p>

<p>"He doesn't care," said Sapphira, "he's a terribly stupid
thing, he sleeps all the time."</p>

<p>Just then a large, brightly colored bird was seen flying
towards them. He had a beautiful topknot of green and yellow
feathers that shone in the sun, and made him look very grand.
He alighted on the sand alongside of Sapphira, and began to
smooth out his feathers as if he were very proud of them.</p>

<p>"The Squawking Cockatoo," said the Walrus.</p>

<p>Then they all shouted together, "Good morning, Cockatoo."</p>

<p>The Cockatoo nodded his head very gravely in return, and
said,</p>

<p>"What are you all talking about?"</p>

<p>"About Sapphira's coming to pay us a visit and spend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
day," said the Walrus, "she can't get out to us, and we can't
get in to her, and we were just discussing asking the Flying Pig
what he could do to help us, but she says he is locked up."</p>

<p>"You can't get the key?" said the Cockatoo to Sapphira.
Sapphira shook head.</p>

<p>"And he can't get out unless you do?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sapphira.</p>

<p>"What are the bars of the cage made of?" asked the
Cockatoo, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Something shiny that looks like gold, but I don't think
it is real gold," answered Sapphira.</p>

<p>"You couldn't possibly bite them through with your beak,"
said the Walrus, "of course they would be too hard for that."</p>

<p>The Cockatoo gave a little strut of pride. "They would
have to be much harder than anything I've seen yet," he said.</p>

<p>Sapphira had become very interested now, and she left the
fort, and came over to the side of the Cockatoo.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Cockatoo," she said, "if you could only invent
a way to get the Flying Pig out of his cage so that I could go
and spend the day with the Walruses it would be so splendid.
<i>Do</i> you think you could?"</p>

<p>The Cockatoo gave a queer, squeaky sound,&mdash;Sapphira
was not sure whether it was meant to be a laugh or not, it
certainly did not sound much like one,&mdash;and said,</p>

<p>"You be at the cage at nine to-morrow morning, and we'll
see," then spreading his large parti-colored wings he flew away.</p>

<p>Sapphira was so excited that she entirely forgot to notice
that the water had gone into the trench around the fort, or
that the sand she was standing on was very wet, and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
herself would be very wet the next wave that came up. The
excitement of spending the day with the Walruses was too much
for her, and they were excited too, and bobbed up and down
on the waves more wildly than ever. They all shouted to her
at once of the pleasures in store for her, but a large wave that
curled lovingly around Sapphira's feet, quite wetting her shoes
and stockings, brought her to herself reminded her rather unpleasantly
that she would probably be scolded when she got
home.</p>

<p>She started at once, however, thinking it was better to have
it over, and the joy of to-morrow could not be spoiled by a
scolding about wet feet. As she went by the Flying Pig's cage,
she stopped a minute and asked him if he would like to get
out. He looked at her with one eye, the other being closed,
and said sleepily,</p>

<p>"I never have been out. Silly girl! you know the cage
is locked."</p>

<p>"But would you like to?" persisted Sapphira.</p>

<p>The Pig moved restlessly in the straw. "Don't talk about
it, please," he said, "it makes me feel wakeful."</p>

<p>Sapphira laughed and ran off to the house, thinking gleefully
how pleased he would be to-morrow.</p>

<p>To-morrow was a beautiful day, and Sapphira was up
early, and by nine o'clock was out by the cage, and here a new
difficulty appeared for the first time. How was she to distract
the attention of the two page boys, while the Squawking Cockatoo
bit through the bars? While she was thinking, she
suddenly remembered a beautiful pale blue and pink ball that
had been given her by her Fairy Godmother on her last birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>day.
She couldn't tell why she had thought of it, but it seemed
almost as though someone had said to her, "Go and get your
fairy ball." She brought it out, and invited the boys to a game.
The ball, being a fairy one, and knowing perfectly well what
was expected of it, led the boys farther and farther away from
the cage until they were quite out of sight, and Sapphira, running
to the bars, called</p>

<p>"Flying Pig! Flying Pig! wake up. The Squawking
Cockatoo is coming, he's going to bite through the bars of your
cage, and you are to take me on your back to the Walruses, so
that I may spend the day with them. Do you hear, Flying Pig?"</p>

<p>Of course he heard, and he was quite as excited as Sapphira.
"And after I've taken you to the Walruses," he said, "may I
fly around myself?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, you may," said Sapphira, "only you must
bring me back by five, so that I won't be missed."</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> shall be missed," said the Flying Pig, very sadly,
"No use, Sapphira. When they come out to give me my
dinner, they'll find the cage empty, and the magic weathervane
would show where I was. I tell you it's no use," and he sank
down, and large tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't one of the common pigs come in, in your
place? I'm sure they would love to spend the day in your
cage, and they would never say a word."</p>

<p>The Flying Pig brightened considerably. "That would
do," he said. "Could you get one of them up here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Sapphira, "I'm sure the fattest one would
follow me, he knows me quite well, and oh, <i>here</i> is the Squawking
Cockatoo."</p>

"SAPPHIRA SEATED ON THE BACK OF THE FLYING PIG"
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Sure enough, the beautiful bird swooped down like a glittering
rainbow on the top of the gilded cage.</p>

<p>"Is everything all ready?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sapphira explained about her having to get the common
pig, and the Cockatoo agreed, only saying she must do it at once,
as there was not a minute to be lost.</p>

<p>The Fattest Pig was very glad to see Sapphira, and perfectly
willing to do as he was told, in fact spending the day in
the Flying Pig's cage was the one ambition of his lazy soul.
When they got back to the cage, they found the Cockatoo had
been as good as his word, and four bars had been bitten through.
In less time than it takes to tell, the Flying Pig was out, and
the Fattest Pig was in, the bars were replaced, and Sapphira,
seated on the back of the Flying Pig, and accompanied by the
Squawking Cockatoo, was on her way to the ocean.</p>

<p>They found the Walruses all drawn up in line, just outside
the breakers. They had with them a dear little boat, for
they pointed out to Sapphira she couldn't sit on their backs
without getting very wet, as they swam so low in the water.
It was decided that the Flying Pig should be back in that same
spot at half-past four, and having planted Sapphira safely in the
bottom of the little boat, he flew away with squeals of joy.</p>

<p>The Walruses started immediately, drawing the little boat
after them, and they seemed to swim quite a long, long way, till
they came to an island that was just covered with walruses of
all sizes and shapes. They were perfectly delighted to see Sapphira,
and hastened to the water's edge, with shouts of welcome.
The wife of the biggest Walrus, who was Sapphira's greatest
friend, took charge of the entertainment, and it was she who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
directed the landing of the boat, and made the little speech of
welcome to Sapphira.</p>

<p>Then followed a day of such wild gayety that Sapphira
thinks she will never forget it, if she lives to be a hundred.
The Walruses showed her caves of the most beautiful colors
where the mermaids lived. They taught her how to dive off
of the rocks, so that she could go straight to the bottom and
bring up some of the lovely flowers that grew down there, and
Sapphira wondered why she had never been able to do it before,
for she had always bathed, but somehow this seemed quite
different. Then some of the little Walruses were so funny, the
way they tumbled off the rocks, and crawled up again.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day they had dinner, served out on
the rocks, and everything was delicious, though Sapphira couldn't
tell what one of the dishes was. After dinner the biggest Walrus
suggested that they should go and visit the Old Man of the Sea,
so Sapphira got into the boat, and the Walruses pulling it, they
went quite a long way till they came to a funny little pointed
rock that rose right out of the sea, and had a little gold bell
hanging on its top. This bell one of the Walruses rang, and
then they all waited. Pretty soon there was a sort of a bubbling
on the surface of the water near the rock, and a most
beautiful mermaid appeared.</p>

<p>When she saw Sapphira she seemed quite pleased, and
asked if she were coming down to see the Old Man of the Sea.
Sapphira said "yes" and the mermaid took hold of the edge of
the boat and said, "shut your eyes," which Sapphira did. She
felt the queerest rushing sensation, and the water surged all
around her ears, and for a minute she was awfully frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
but the next minute she heard the voice of the mermaid saying,
"open your eyes, Sapphira," and she was standing in a gorgeous
hall, all mother of pearl in the most lovely colors. They went
through this into a large room, and seated on a pink coral
throne was the Old Man of the Sea. He was very old, with
long gray hair and curling beard, but he had kind eyes, and he
was very glad to see Sapphira. He gave her a lovely string of
pearls to remember him by, and just as they had begun to be
very friendly, and Sapphira was telling him about the Flying
Pig and the Squawking Cockatoo, the mermaid came hurrying
in.</p>

<p>"The Walruses say you must go, Sapphira," she said. "It
is after half-past four, and the Flying Pig has been missed."</p>

<p>Sapphira said "good-bye" hurriedly, took her seat in the
boat, and was rushed up again to the surface of the ocean.
There were the Walruses in great excitement. The Squawking
Cockatoo had come to tell them that the Flying Pig had been
missed, and that there was the greatest hullabaloo.</p>

<p>"It appears that the Fattest Pig was fool enough to grunt
several times with pleasure over his dinner," said the Cockatoo,
severely. "Of course everyone knows that the Flying Pig does
not grunt and the page boys gave the alarm at once."</p>

<p>Sapphira was hustled ashore on the back of the Flying
Pig, accompanied by the Cockatoo, who wanted to see the end
of the fight.</p>

<p>When they reached the cage they found the entire family
gathered around, all talking at once, and Sapphira's mother was
wringing her hands, in despair, for the little girl had also been
missed. The Flying Pig, with Sapphira on his back, floated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
down quietly and remained stationary a little above the top of
the cage. One of the page boys looked up and saw him.</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, Flying Pig," said Sapphira's father, "where <i>have</i> you
been? and Sapphira, too!"</p>

<p>"We've been out," said the Flying Pig, quietly, "and
what is more, I'm not coming back unless you promise me that
the doors of the cage shall be left unlocked between the hours
of two and five every day, so that I may go out. I'm tired to
death of being locked up, and I won't have it."</p>

<p>"It shall be as you wish, Flying Pig, only come back,"
said Sapphira's father.</p>

<p>"The door of the cage shall be left open?" asked the Pig,
still a little suspicious.</p>

<p>"Absolutely open," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And Sapphira may go with me whenever I want to take
her?" asked the Pig, coming a little nearer.</p>

<p>"Whenever you want to take her."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Pig, alighting on the ground, "then
we'll come back."</p>

<p>Everyone was so glad to see them that they quite forgot to
scold, and from that time the Flying Pig goes out every day,
and he almost always takes Sapphira with him, and usually the
Squawking Cockatoo goes too.</p>

<h2 id="TREES">THE CHRISTMAS TREES</h2></div>


<p>Of course, they were bright. Otherwise they could hardly
have been for a Christmas tree. They were twelve
in a box, and they ran in twos as to color&mdash;by this I
mean that there were two blues, two reds, two greens,
two silvery, two goldy, and two bright pink. The box was
divided into little compartments, one for each ball, and lined
with a peculiar, dirty cotton, common to Christmas ornament
boxes, and the compartments were meant to keep the balls from
knocking against each other and breaking. This it did, but it
did not keep them from constantly squabbling, fighting and
fussing, which, I am sorry to say, they did all the time.</p>

<p>They stood, or rather their box stood, on a big table with
many other ornaments in Wanamaker's big store, and the never-ceasing
crowd pushed backwards and forwards by them all the
day. They were much admired by all, but no one bought them.
It seemed that being rather a high order of ornament they were
quite expensive, so they leaned against the edge of the shelf, and
shone, glistened, fought and quarreled as to which was the
prettier&mdash;until the others were tired of hearing them.</p>

<p>A large Santa Claus, resplendent in a red overcoat, stood
on the top shelf in the center, trying to keep order, and around
him a row of smaller and less magnificent Santa Claus' with
black coats, trying to help, but he was not so expensive as the
balls, so they paid no heed to him.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the goldy balls&mdash;they always spoke together,&mdash;"you
may say what you like, but none of you shine as
we do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"We think we give a purer and less lurid light," remarked
the silver.</p>

<p>"You may do that, but you don't light up as we do," said
the red balls.</p>

<p>"And we;" "And we," shouted the others.</p>

<p>"A nice, fat baby just came by on his mother's arm and
tried to take me out of the box," said the top pink ball, trembling
with pleasure. "I hoped his mother would buy me."</p>

<p>"We are not for sale singly," said the other pink, a little
hurt that the baby had not seen him, "besides he would have
squeezed you, and broken you, then you might have cut his
fingers."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to do that," said the first pink ball again,
looking anxious. "I hope he won't come again, he might
snatch me."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, if he snatches at all, it will be at us,"
said the gold balls again.</p>

<p>"Or at us," shouted all the others.</p>

<p>"Ding, dong, peace, peace," rang a bell, which hung on
a trimmed tree at the corner of the table, "how you quarrel!
Santa Claus, can't you stop them?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, sadly, "they don't heed me, they
are so noisy."</p>

<p>"Is this the one you mean?" a voice broke through the
babble, and a hand took down the box. With one accord the
gaily colored balls shivered, and each one closed his or her eyes,
afraid to even breathe.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. See, Estelle, what pretty ones, and
quite unusual," said another voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said the shop-girl, "we have only one of
these, they are a little higher priced than what we usually carry."</p>

<p>The balls swelled with pride at this, and then being unable
to restrain their curiosity any longer, they opened their eyes, and
looked right up into the pale, pretty face of a little girl, who was
gazing at them, but with a very small show of interest. Goldy
decided she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
She wore a black velvet coat, with a wide fur collar, and a big
hat with plumes, her fair hair was beautifully curled, and she
looked very dainty in the rough crowd. Pinky sighed as he
looked at her.</p>

<p>"I would rather be with my baby," she whispered, "that
little girl looks discontented and unhappy."</p>

<p>They were already on the way to be wrapped up, before
they quite took in what had happened. Even then they were
so excited they forgot to quarrel.</p>

<p>"I expect we shall be on a very smart tree," said the green,
"and they will take such care of us that we shall last years. I
had a friend once who was on the family Christmas tree for five
years, and he was not so nice as we are."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll take care of us all right," said Silver. "Didn't
you hear the lady say we were the prettiest she had seen yet, and
so unusual?" And then they all bridled in their snug little
compartments.</p>

<p>The night was spent they knew not just where, but in the
vicinity of a Christmas tree and greens, for they could hear them
whispering, and an occasional whiff of piney smell came under
the lid of the box. The morning passed quietly too, their string
was untied, and the box looked into by the same lady who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
bought them, then they were left on the floor with a lot of other
boxes and much general conversation took place. The balls
felt rather strange and kept very still.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great commotion, the room became
full of people, all talking at once, and there was hammering and
rustling, as the tree was set in place, and the greens tacked on
the walls. Then the lid was taken off the box, and the balls
saw that they were in a large room, full of people. In the
center a great tree stretched its branches, waiting to be trimmed;
innumerable bundles tied with bright ribbons were piled around,
and the walls were hung with greens and wreaths. Near the tree
was "their lady," and it was the little girl who had opened the
box. She looked more happy and interested now, and was even
more gorgeous than ever, with a velvet frock and lace collar, a
big bow on her yellow curls.</p>

<p>"This," said the gold balls, "is richness and luxury.
Thank goodness, we were high priced, and came here to live."</p>

<p>The others all agreed, but the pink ball,&mdash;she had a little
pang of regret when she thought of the fat baby with the bright,
earnest little face, and the well-worn worsted hood tied under
its fat, chapped chin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trimming of the tree progressed rapidly.
A great many beautiful and costly things were hung on it, among
others our friends, who were prouder than ever, and shone to
the best of their ability. Goldy made the acquaintance of a
beautiful paper doll, with feather wings and gold paper skirts,
who floated on the branch next to him, by the aid of an elastic
glued to her shoulder. She was very aristocratic and hard to
know, but he glistened his best and swung to and fro with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and was happy. The green balls hung near the top, and were
next to a large scarlet ball that came straight from Germany,
and only spoke that language; but the greens were very good
natured, and as they spoke a little German, they got along
famously.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, the people went to get dressed,
and left the tree alone in all its grandeur, a big Santa Claus
taking charge of the heap of toys piled at its base.</p>

<p>Once alone, the ornaments began to talk, amicably at first,
but later, I regret to say, the quarrelling commenced. Goldy
began it. He stated in no very agreeable tone that he was glad
they were in a house befitting their station.</p>

<p>"Your station, indeed," said the big spike on the top,
"why, you came from Wanamaker's!"</p>

<p>Absolute silence followed this remark, and the little balls
turned cold with fright and shame. Was it then a disgrace to
come from Wanamaker's? The red ball looked pale, and the
green balls grew greener still.</p>

<p>"Wanamaker's is a large department store, is it not, where
all sorts of things are sold?" asked a silver horse, who pranced
on one of the upper branches.</p>

<p>"Yes," said its companion, a gold cow, who seemed out of
place, hanging as it did head down from a lower branch. "They
sell everything from a wardrobe to a rolling pin."</p>

<p>"They have a lovely toy department," spoke up a new
voice; and looking towards the corner from whence it came
they beheld a rather the worse for wear doll. "I have been
there often with Estelle, and some of their things are very high
priced."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>("That," thought the balls, "is a lovely doll, we will do
something for her if we can.")</p>

<p>"High priced," said the horse, "were you high priced?"
turning a little to the red ball who hung near him.</p>

<p>"We were," answered all the balls in chorus, "that is why
we had not been sold before."</p>

<p>"Toys," said a beautiful, soft voice, "toys, be quiet, do
you know what we are celebrating?"</p>

<p>"Christmas," answered several softly.</p>

<p>"Do any of you know what Christmas means?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and all eyes turned upward to
where the Christmas Angel hung from the ceiling by a broad
ribbon tied around its waist. Its arms were outspread above
the tree, and its dimpled hand seemed to be showering blessings
on all. As no one answered, the Angel went on gravely:</p>

<p>"We are celebrating the birth of Christ. I am the image
of the Angel who brought the news, and I come each year to
each tree to remind all people that 'Unto you a Child is born,'
and you all pain me by quarrelling over prices at such a time."</p>

<p>A sort of shamed silence settled on all the toys. The gold
ball glanced at his lady love, but she was looking gravely down
into the green below. Then Santa Claus gave himself a little
shake.</p>

<p>"You have made us all feel solemn, when we want to be
gay," he said. "Can't some one start a song?"</p>

<p>"I will," said the Angel, and he straightway began chanting,
"'Twas the Night before Christmas," and they all joined
in; and when it was finished all solemnity had disappeared, and
wild gayety and good temper prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The evening was a great success. There were a great
many people, and much light and laughter. The tree was
praised, and our friends came in for their share of the admiration.
When the guests had gone, Mrs. Miller called the maids
to her.</p>

<p>"Undress the tree in the morning," she said. "Save the
larger balls, the dolls, and the tinsel animals, and throw all the
smaller things away. Good-night. Come, Estelle."</p>

<p>Consternation fell on the ornaments. The larger ones gave
sighs of relief, and the smaller ones shudders of horror. The
little balls glanced at one another and laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"She cannot mean us," they said, "we are so beautiful
and expensive." And Pinky thought again of the baby.</p>

<p>"He would never have thrown us away," she murmured
to herself.</p>

<p>The night passed in speculation and very little sleep; and
when the first rays of light peeped in through the shades, one of
the balls&mdash;a blue one&mdash;was discovered on the ground in pieces.
He had thrown himself down rather than be thrown away.</p>

<p>The maids came early, and the work of undoing the tree
began. Slowly the larger articles, including the tinsel animals,
were removed and put away, until nothing remained but a few
cheaper paper ornaments and the sad eleven balls, with their
pride gone, and their souls humbled to the dust. For they were
to be thrown out,&mdash;they, the pride of the Christmas tree table,
and all their boasts were for nothing. The rich had bought
them, and now the rich were throwing them away. The thought
of the ash can made them shiver, and the gold ones hoped they
would break in the act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I thought Christmas Day was different from other days,"
remarked a small, ragged boy to a larger, but equally ragged
little girl, as they slipped and slid on the icy pavement on Christmas
morning, in search of any odd bits that might be left in the
ash cans that plentifully sprinkled the edge of the curb at this
early hour.</p>

<p>"It is different, someway," answered the small girl, vaguely.
"There's presents for some folks and trees, I think it's trees, for
others."</p>

<p>"Trees? What for? I don't think a tree is much of a
present," sniffed the little boy, contemptuously, "I'd rather
have a drum."</p>

<p>"I don't mean a plain tree, Jimmy Tyler, I mean a tree
all hung with things made out of shining stuff, and candles, and
gold glass balls." Jimmy was struck dumb.</p>

<p>"Gold glass, O my! I ain't never seen gold glass," he
gasped.</p>

<p>"No, neither have I," answered the sister, "but Billy's
Mama says so."</p>

<p>That seemed to be convincing, and they both poked away
at the contents of two large ash cans, until a scream from Jimmy
caused Sadie to jump almost out of her worn little shoes.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "is this one of them things?" In his
hand he was holding the one remaining blue ball. He had a
hole in one side, but he still had courage and tried bravely to
shine, even though the dust had enveloped him. Sadie stood
spellbound.</p>

<p>"It is one of them," she said. "Oh, who could have
thrown it away?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sadie," screamed Jimmy, "could we take it home and
put it on a tree for Billy? We could borrow a candle."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it would look bad all alone, Jimmy," she said
sadly, "but," seeing the intense disappointment she had caused,
"we can do it. First, let's hunt through the ashes some more.
If they throw one away, there may be others."</p>

<p>The diligent search was rewarded beyond their wildest
hope, for not only did the entire eleven appear, all very dusty
and broken in spirit and thankful to be able to breathe once
more, but also the remains of Goldy's lady love, one wing gone,
and her golden skirts in ribbons, but still beautiful in the children's
eyes.</p>

<p>While they were contemplating their treasures with joy
beyond words, a man came out of the area way, dragging a
tremendous Christmas tree after him, which he threw into the
gutter and then proceeded to chop up. Sadie watched him
silently for a minute, and then with her face pink with the effort,
approached him timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, <i>could</i> you chop it so we could have the top?"</p>

<p>The man looked kindly at the two earnest faces, and at
the toys in the little cold hands.</p>

<p>"Of course, I could," he said heartily, "how much of the
top will you be wanting?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a little piece," said Sadie. "We haven't very
much to put on it."</p>

<p>"How will you carry it?" asked the man, when he had
finished.</p>

<p>"On my sled," said Jimmy, exhibiting with pride a box
on runners, made by himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the man, after the balls had been
carefully stowed away in the bottom on a soft bed of branches,
and the tree placed on top. "I have something inside you will
like," and going into the house, he reappeared with two bright
cornucopias of candy, a nice red apple and an orange.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you," cried the children. "What
a Christmas Billy will have!"</p>

<p>"Who's Billy?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"He is the baby of our house, his mother rents the back
room on the top floor. They're poor, too, and we love Billy."</p>

<p>"Sadie takes care of him in the daytime when his mother
gets work, and she's a splendid nurse," said Jimmy with pride.
Then with nods and smiles they started. The man watched
them until they disappeared, and then with a half sigh returned
to his chopping.</p>

<p>"I wish I had asked where they lived, I would like to
have seen the tree and Billy," he thought, but it was too late,
the ragged pair and the old sled with its cheery burden had gone
around the corner.</p>

<p>And what of our friends, the balls, down in their nest of
pine boughs? They were too happy to speak. The events of
the night passed among ashes and bits of coal had told much
on their delicate nerves, and the sudden change to the fragrant
bed, with a prospect of another tree ahead of them was as cheering
to them as it was to the children. All pride had gone, and
there was left only a strong desire to make such a brave appearance
that Billy's tree would be the best and brightest in the
land, notwithstanding the fact that the ornaments were few.</p>

<p>And it was a bright little tree, set up in a starch box, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the balls hung where they showed to the best advantage, and
the paper dolly tied fast to the top bough, where her tattered
skirts were less noticeable, and no one minded or even thought
that she had only one wing. The gold balls glistened as good
as new when the dust was rubbed off, and when later the candle
had burned out, the apple and the orange had been divided and
eaten, and the festivities were over, the little pink ball rejoiced
to find herself going to bed with the fat baby; then clasped
tight in the hot little hand and nestling close to the pink cheek,
she sent up a little prayer of thanks to the Christmas Angel,
which was as near saying real prayers as a Christmas tree ornament
ever comes.</p>

<h2 id="PARTY">MOTHER GOOSE'S PARTY</h2></div>


<p>Mother Goose had decided to give a party. Not
an ordinary affair, by any means, but a <i>very</i> extraordinary
party. She had been looking down into New
York a great deal lately, as she went her rounds on
her big white goose, and had seen more than one little boy and
girl reading her "Rhymes and Jingles," and heard them exclaim;</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I could go to see Mother Goose, and all
the story-people!"</p>

<p>So Mother Goose had decided to invite the children, that
is, the best and nicest only, those who didn't cry when they were
being dressed, or when there was no jam for supper. They were
to come in the evening, for that is the time when they can reach
Fairyland by the shortest way, and she was going to ask all the
most interesting people of the "Rhymes and Jingles" to help
entertain them.</p>

<p>So pleased was Mother Goose with her plan, that she had
to call out to the old woman with the pig who lived next door,
and who was cleaning house very hard, always in hopes of finding
another silver sixpence, to ask her if she would come and
bring her pig.</p>

<p>The old woman thought it would be lovely, and offered to
help prepare for the party. She suggested that the Queen of
Hearts might give the celebrated tarts by way of refreshments.
Mother Goose liked the idea, and decided to send a message to
the queen by the very first person who came in. This person
happened to be the Maiden All Forlorn, who had just milked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
her cow, and brought in a nice saucer of milk for Mother Goose's
cat, and she offered to go at once and fetch the tarts.</p>

<p>The next people to come were Jack and Jill, with a bucket
half full of water. They were now so used to falling down the
hill, that they managed to keep a little water in the pail, and
they always brought it to Mother Goose, who used it to wash
her nice tiled floor. They were crazy about the plan, and
promised to do what they could to make it a success.</p>

<p>"We will be here just as early as we can," said Jill, "you
know we have to help Bo-peep find her blessed sheep, and, fit
on all their tails the first thing in the morning, and it takes a
long time."</p>

<p>"Then let them come without their tails, let Bo-peep bring
the tails with her," said Mother Goose. "I dare say the children
would like that quite as well."</p>

<p>"What are you going to have to eat?" asked Jack, who
took a great deal of interest in food.</p>

<p>Mother Goose told them about the tarts, and Jill suggested
some of Curlylocks' strawberries and cream, also Tommy Tucker's
white and brown bread. Tommy came along just then on
his way to the village to buy a knife, and promised to bring
plenty of both kinds of bread with him.</p>

<p>"I know something," said Jill, "why don't you get some
one to go to the King of the Blackbird Pie, and ask him to give
it to us. Even if we didn't eat it, the children would be amused
to see it."</p>

<p>"There are two objections to that plan," said Mother
Goose, thoughtfully, "one, that it is a very long way to go, and
the second, that the top crust of the pie is broken, and the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
won't have it mended because now the four-and-twenty black
birds can sing all day long. It would spoil the looks to have
no top on the pie."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should think that could be managed," said Jack,
"the maid's good-natured, that is, if she has the tip of her nose.
Perhaps she would make a new top."</p>

<p>"Well, that doesn't solve the question of getting the pie,"
said Jill, settling herself on the kitchen table, and swinging
her feet. "I tell you who runs fast, Tom, Tom, the Piper's
son."</p>

<p>"But he'd never be able to bring the pie back," said
Mother Goose, "he always has the pig to carry. Since they
killed the first pig he doesn't dare put this one down. But
never mind, Jill, I'll find some way of getting it. I'm going
out now, and I will look."</p>

<p>"We must go, too," said Jack and Jill, "or Bo-peep will
be screaming. There she is now," and sure enough along the
road, preceded by a sound of loud weeping, came Bo-peep,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bo-peep, do stop crying a minute, and listen, and
I'll tell you what a beautiful plan Mother Goose has. She is
to give a party to all the children in New York, and you're to
come." Bo-peep looked pleased for a minute, then began to
cry again.</p>

<p>"What good am I," she sobbed, "at any party, without
my sheep?"</p>

<p>"But we'll find your sheep," said Jack, "don't we find
them for you every day? To-day won't be any different.
Come on, Jill," and each taking one of Bo-peep's hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
waving gaily to Mother Goose, they dragged her off down the
hill.</p>

<p>Mother Goose started across the fields on her goose, turning
over in her mind the different people who might go for the
blackbird pie. Suddenly she came upon a haycock and under
it, sound asleep, with his head resting on his arm, was Little Boy
Blue. Mother Goose dismounted, and picking up the horn that
lay alongside of him, gave him a good rap over the head with
it. Boy Blue woke up with a lazy yawn, and said:</p>

<p>"You let me alone." When he saw who it was, he jumped
to his feet, and bowed very politely, for most of the Fairyland
children were afraid of Mother Goose when she was cross.</p>

<p>"Boy Blue, will you do something for me?" asked Mother
Goose, and she told him about the pie. "How can you get it?
The palace is such a long way off."</p>

<p>"I can do it," said Boy Blue, cheerfully and pleasantly,
"I can take Baa, Baa, Black Sheep out of the lane. He goes,
by the King's palace every day, with wool for My Lady."</p>

<p>Mother Goose was pleased at Boy Blue's willingness to do
the errand, and left him with a warning to "be quick." Boy
Blue started at once for the lane, and sure enough, there was Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep trotting along. He consented to take Boy
Blue on his back to the King's palace. So they started, and
were there within an hour, as Black Sheep could travel very
quickly when he wanted to. When they arrived, Boy Blue ran
in, and found the King in his counting-house, just as he expected.
Boy Blue explained to him about the party, and the King said
he would gladly give the pie, but spoke of its not having a top.
Then he said he thought the maid would make a new one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Boy Blue ran to ask her if she would. She was very good-natured
that morning, the dicky-bird having let her nose alone,
and she consented to make one right away.</p>

<p>Then came the difficulty of carrying the pie, which was
very large and heavy, to Mother Goose's house, but here the
Queen came to the rescue. She had offered some of her bread
and honey to the party, and she suggested that Cinderella would
probably let Boy Blue have her pumpkin coach to drive back
in.</p>

<p>"You know," said the Queen, "she sends her coach into
the village every day, to drive past the house where the proud
sisters live so as to make them envious, and as it is empty, Boy
Blue might just as well ride in it."</p>

<p>While the maid baked the top of the pie Boy Blue went at
once to ask Cinderella about it. She lived quite close to the
palace, so he wasn't long finding her. On the way he met
Simple Simon, who was going fishing, and told him about the
party, and Simon was so simple that he promised a great many
fish, out of his mother's pail, for the feast.</p>

<p>Cinderella was very glad to see Boy Blue. She said she
would be at the party, and bring her glass slippers, and as the
coach was just starting, she was delighted to have Boy Blue use
it. By the time he had returned to the palace the maid had
put a lovely fancy top on the pie,&mdash;with "Mother Goose"
written in large letters upon the crust,&mdash;and Boy Blue put it
very carefully on the seat opposite to him in Cinderella's pumpkin
coach. The drive back was pretty tiresome, for the pie
seemed excited at the prospect of the party, and kept sliding
backwards and forwards on the seat, in a most annoying way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and once it nearly bounced out the window, and Boy Blue had
to push it back so hard that all the four and twenty blackbirds
began to twitter very angrily,&mdash;they did not like being bounced,&mdash;but
they got home at last without accident.</p>

"AND THEY HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME"
</div></div>

<p>The children arrived at half past eight, and were much
interested to see Mother Goose's kitchen, her cat, the celebrated
goose, and Bo-peep's sheep, which were all there, just as Jack
said they would be. Of course their tails weren't fitted on, but
this made it all the more interesting. For the children could
put the tails on themselves. Bo-peep was so tired doing it, she
was glad enough to let them. They visited Mary, Mary, Quite
Contrary's garden, and she gave them each a silver bell, with
their names written on, to take home.</p>

<p>When supper time came, there was a great deal of excitement
as to what there would be to eat, and perhaps you can
imagine how the children all felt, when the four-and-twenty
blackbirds popped up their heads and sang a cheery welcome to
the fairy world. They had all the things to eat that they had
read about for years, and they had such a good time that they
were ready to cry when the bull tolled the big bell to tell them
it was time to go home.</p>

<p>Mother Goose promised them to have another party sometime,
but she seems to have forgotten,&mdash;at least we have never
been asked!</p>
